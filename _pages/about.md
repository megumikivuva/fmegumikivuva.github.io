I am a **National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow at the University of Washington, Seattle, advised by Prof. Amy Ko**. My PhD research aims to broaden participation in computing education for Black and refugee students. I use community participatory research to understand the barriers to accessing computing education and co-design interventions to make computing education more accessible to these communities. My previous work includes CS integration in language learning, co-construction in CS classes, and teaching CS in various after-school settings. I hold a BA in Computer Science and Spanish Studies from Bard College. In my free time I enjoy cooking Kenyan food and baking bread, cookies, and brownies!
